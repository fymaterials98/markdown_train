I think you should use  
`<address>` element here instead  
Hereâ€™s an example of Python code without syntax highlighting:  
def foo()  
    if not bar:  
        return True  
```
def foo():  
    if not bar:  
        return True  
```
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

## Rule #1
___
   
Block code that is **python**-specific:  
```python
print "hello world!"
print "hello moon"
```
